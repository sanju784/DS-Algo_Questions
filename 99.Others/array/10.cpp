/**

In C++, self-balancing-bianry-search-tree is implemented by set, map and multimap.
We canft use set here as we have key value pairs (not only keys).
We also canft directly use map also as a single key can belong to multiple values and map allows a single value
for a key. So we use multimap which stores key value pairs and can have multiple values for a key.

1. Store the values in the multimap with the difference with X as key.
2. In multiimap, the values will be already in sorted order according to key
i.e. difference with X because it implements self-balancing-bianry-search-tree internally.
3. Update all the values of array with the values of map so that array has the required output.
